# Shrimpcity

A website for fictional music venue Shrimpcity, built out in Laravel.

## Why this project?

- Wanted to give Laravel a shot, thus far I really like it
- To have a referral project for my upcoming internship
- Music venues are awesome

## To do's

- Automaticly remove events after they took place, maybe move them to some kind of archive page
- Add srcsets and sizes to the img-tags
- Add filter/search functionalty for shows
- Add more strict typing
- Add an admin part to the website to give it the full CRUD experience. Will probably do this in Vue. I know this doesn't really make sense projectwise but while still learning I also want to gain a deeper understanding of that framework.
- Add more possibilities: more bands, 'special' events such as festivals with a specific view,...
- Deploy it to Railway.com or some other free tier service so I can link it to this Github repo
- ...
