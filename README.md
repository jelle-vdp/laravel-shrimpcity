# Shrimpcity

A website for concert venue Shrimpcity built out in Laravel

## Why this project?

- Wanted to give Laravel a shot, thus far I really like it
- To have a referral project for my upcoming internship
- I love live music and I think that the shrimp loving band Viagra Boys is great

## To do's

- Automaticly remove events after they took place, maybe move them to some kind of archive page.
- Make the website responsive
- Add more strict typing
- Add an admin part to the website to give it the full CRUD experience, will probably do this in React. I know this doesn't really make sense projectwise but while still learning I also want to gain a deeper understanding of that framework.
- Add more possibilities: e.g. making a show a special event like 'Shrimp Beach Fest' with more bands and thus also an updated view
- Deploy it to Railway.com or some other free tier service so I can link it to this Github repo

## How to install
